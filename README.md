MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier using CNN
This repository contains a Colab notebook that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to build and train a deep learning model capable of accurately recognizing and classifying handwritten digits (0-9) based on the MNIST dataset. The notebook walks through the process of loading and preprocessing the data, defining the CNN architecture, compiling and training the model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
The project uses the well-known MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.

Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using the Keras Sequential API and consists of the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input images using filters.
MaxPooling Layers: Downsample the feature maps, reducing spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
Flatten Layer: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers that perform classification based on the extracted features.
Dropout Layer: A regularization technique to prevent overfitting.
Output Layer: A dense layer with a softmax activation function to output the probability distribution over the 10 digit classes.
How to Run the Code
Open the notebook in Google Colab: Upload the .ipynb file to Google Colab or open it directly from GitHub.
Run the cells: Execute the code cells sequentially.
The notebook will automatically download the MNIST dataset.
The code will preprocess the data, define and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.
Plots of training history (accuracy and loss) will be displayed.
Interpreting Results: The notebook will output the test accuracy of the trained model and display plots showing how the accuracy and loss changed during training.
Dependencies
The main libraries required are:

TensorFlow
Keras (included in TensorFlow)
NumPy
Matplotlib
These dependencies are readily available in the Google Colab environment.

Results
After training, the model achieves a test accuracy of approximately [Insert your achieved test accuracy here, e.g., 99.00%]. The plots illustrate the model's learning progress and convergence.
